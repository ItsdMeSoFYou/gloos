His parents moved with him to the Karlsruhe area of Baden-Württemberg in mid-2002. There he went to the kindergarten St. Maria in Schielberg together with his sister Lara who was born on 29.12.2002 in Karlsruhe. In the same place he also visited the Carl-Benz-School for two years, in the third grade he changed to the Waldhaus-School in Malsch, because his teacher at that time had problems with his restless nature. At this time Pascal also had his first contact with instruments, when he started taking piano lessons at the age of nine. At the beginning of the fifth grade, he then transferred to the Schloss-Schule in Stutensee, where he completed his secondary schooling. Because this was an all-day school, he had to stop taking piano lessons at the end of eighth grade, but at that time he had already started working with FL Studio, which was also the start of his current music career. He received his middle school leaving certificate in 2017 at the Realschule der Wilhelm-Ganzhorn-Schulen in Conweiler. Due to the fact that after the tenth grade no training started and he was unemployed, he used the time to improve his skills in FL Studio, but this was interrupted on 21 June 2018 by a ruptured aneurysm in the cerebellum. After a 4-week coma and a 6-week stay in hospital, he was admitted for nine months to the Hegau-Jugendwerk Rehabilitation Clinic in Gailingen on the Hochrhein, where he recovered almost completely. After his release on February 25, 2019, he decided to take his high school diploma at the Academy for Communication in Pforzheim. He also switched from FL Studio to Ableton because he liked the workflow with Ableton better. In January 2020 he released his first single called Energy under the artist name Tissøt, which he changed to Gloos at the end of March 2020. On 16th April of 2021 he released his first single under his new stage name, named Far Away.</blockquote></div>
